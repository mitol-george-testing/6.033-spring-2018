Tutorial 10: Analysis and Evaluation
------------------------------------

This recitation will discuss analysis and evaluation. You will also begin working on your final report.Â  Unlike the proposal document, the report should contain enough detail that it could feasibly be turned over to Facilities for implementation. It should also contain an evaluation of your design. See the [Design Project]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/design-project) section for more details.
